# COFFEE-APP

This is a web project simulating an interactive menu for a coffee shop, offering dynamic features such as product search, product highlighting, email subscription with validation, and a navbar that responds to scrolling.

## Features

- **Live search:** filters the menu in real-time based on input text.
- **Navigation to the menu item** – when a result is clicked, the user is taken directly to that element on the page, which is highlighted.
- **Product highlighting:** users can select a product, which will be highlighted on the page.
- **Newsletter subscription:** includes JavaScript validation for email addresses and visual feedback.
- **Fixed navbar:** on scroll, the navbar stays fixed at the top of the page and changes style to improve readability.
- **Internal page navigation (using anchors)**
